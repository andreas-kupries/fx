- Artifacts are marked as seen even if the sending of their mail
  fails. No idea yet of how to deal with multiple destinations
  associated with a repo where some are ok, and some fail.

- Long term idea: Make the mail multipart/mixed and use the /tinfo
  link for the artifact s source for the text/html part. I.e. send the
  change artifact rendered as html by fossil itself in the mail.

- The type=t filtering of the timeline.rss seems to be broken in fossil.
